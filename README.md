Why are you interested in this field/domain?

The domain of our final project is related to the books. The reason that we choose this domain is that  we are all fond of reading. Books play a quintessential role in everyone’s life by introducing them to a world of imagination, providing knowledge of the outside world, improving their reading, writing, and speaking skills as well as boosting memory and intelligence. We believe that a list of the bestselling books will not only bring people a guide to know more good books but also give people insight into how other people live by broadening their worldview. We hope to find out what books are the most popular among people by this opportunity. With the knowledge that we will process the data, we can find an easier approach to finding the books we may be interested in based on the title, the category, and the review rate.

  We decided to use the dataset “Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2022”, which is collected by Chris Kachmar (Owner) and Sooter Saalu. This dataset is used for Coursera Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study Project. The dataset includes comprehensive information about the books, such as author, user rating, year, selling price, etc., the practical information will help us to answer the data-driven questions.
  
How many observations (rows) are in your data?

  There are 700 books observed.
  
How many features (columns) are in the data?

  There are seven columns in the data.
  
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

  1.Based on the book category, we will be able to generate the brief book genres that the public would like to read.
  
  2.There are multiple books written by one author on the list. According to the review number and user rating, we can find out the most popular author from this dataset.
  
  3.We may discover the price range of the books, and also calculate the average price, which will also be most acceptable to the public, for the different book categories.
  
  4.Since the dataset continues updating the bestselling books from 2009 to 2022, it gives us a chance to evaluate the public reading tendency, for example, we can study the changing in the category of books that people prefer reading from 2009 to 2022.
